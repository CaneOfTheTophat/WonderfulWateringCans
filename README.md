Adds new watering cans to help farm crops and quickly put out fires.

Idea originally from Extra Utilities, implemented as an original standalone mod by Wescook, then forked, updated and overhauled to 1.12.2.

Special thanks to DanteGoldenrod for testing and aid with screenshots.

## Features

Watering cans will:

* Speed up growth ticks (configurable rate)
* Hydrate soil
* Put out fires
* Most importantly, spray liquid particles

## Materials

Watering cans are tiered so there is no obvious "best" choice.

* Stone - Cheap to make, but only stores half a tank.
* Iron - Your standard watering can.  It's a jack of all trades but master of none.
* Gold - Faster hydration (2.5x), but can only be filled once.
* Obsidian - Heavier to use, but offers 5x5 reach.
* Creative - Creative-mode only.  15x15 reach and maximum hydration speed.

## Growth Solution

Growth solution offers a 2x efficiency increase over regular water.  Crafted with a water bucket and bone meal, it can be placed in the world to pick up with your watering can.
